This is an interactive game built using SwiftUI & Swift Playgrounds built to learn the Swift programming language!

This game features 10 exciting challenges that will put your skills to the test:

- Match blur with a slider
- Match opacity, using volume buttons
- Match font size & weight using a radial pad
- Match size by tilting your device
- Match brightness, by controlling your on-device brightness
- Match corner radius, using a slider
- Match color, using a color wheel
- Match bezier-curve, using a control point
- Match angle, by rotating your device
- Match spacing, by dragging rectangles

I encourage you to download and play the game, and even fork the project to make your own modifications! ðŸŽ®
